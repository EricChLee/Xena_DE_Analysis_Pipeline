# Xena Gene Differential Gene Expression analysis pipeline

This pipeline enables you to analyze and visualize your gene expression datasets with an array of downstream analysis and visualization tools. The pipeline includes: PCA analysis, total gene expression analysis, differential gene expression analysis, enrichment analysis, and L1000 small molecule search. The pipeline is adapted from Maayan lab [Bulk RNA-seq analysis pipeline](https://appyters.maayanlab.cloud/#/Bulk_RNA_seq).
